# To-Do List Application

A simple, interactive To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, helping to keep track of daily activities or any other tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Tasks can be checked off once completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete individual tasks.
- **Persistent Tasks**: Tasks remain on the list even after a page reload (using localStorage).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for adding, editing, deleting, and completing tasks. Local storage is used to keep tasks persistent across page reloads.
